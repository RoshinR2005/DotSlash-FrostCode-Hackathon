# DotSlash-FrostCode-Hackathon
The product is set to revolutionise educational management with a comprehensive and innovative solution that combines the power of the Google Maps API, Google Teachable Machine and OpenCV.

## Features
It features real time attendance tracking, schedule/ calendar integration for time tables and a visual map of locations (classrooms, event halls, cafeterias, etc…) across an institute providing an overview of information pertaining to each location on the map within the institute

## Implementation
The interface makes use of React/ Tailwindcss for the web app, that provides all the information at a glance in an intuitive and accessible manner. The software utilises Google Firebase for data management, Google Teachable Machine for ML/ AI related tasks and the Google Maps API for producing an interactive UI. The OpenCV library will allow for accurate identification and tracking of individuals for attendance, maintaining a record of availability of faculty, students as well as locations. The project will have API endpoints built on Python’s Flask/ Django libraries. The combination of these technologies produce an extensible system whose features can grow with time and can scale flexibly.
